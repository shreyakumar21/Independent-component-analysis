# Independent-component-analysis

The aim is to recover the source signals by having minimal information about the 
source data. This is where independent component analysis, or ICA, comes to play. This technique is 
also best backed up by the ‘Cocktail Party Problem’. We are basically looking to recover the source 
signals U(n,t), where n is the number of signals and t is the length of each signal when it is mixed
with a mixing matrix A(m,n), where m is the number of mixed signals that resulted in the mixed 
signals X(m,t) = AU. It is a technique that recovers source data with minimal or no information of it.
